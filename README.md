# Chemistry project of EducationLabs
This project aims to write chemistry textbook based on syllabus of Indian school curriculum. Book will cover concepts present in NCERT books as well as syllabus prescribed by other prominent education boards that have prominent presence in India. We will be working on creating a master document (Chemistry book in English language) in accessible langulage and having local context. Later, this document will be translated into as many Indian languages as possible (which will require participation of students and educators in large numbers). We aspire to use local languages as they are being spoken by kids of relevant age as opposed to typical academic language jargon. The  Final version will be a composite bilingual book.
